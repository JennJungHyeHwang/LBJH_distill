We will specifically be focused on:\nNorth America, South America, Europe, Asia, And Africa. When we are looking at total data we will be focused on February 2021 until Now (November 2021). We will define the time period\nwe are comparing along with the graphical data. We also have data for the countries with the largest numbers of graduates in the STEM field, we then relate those countries to their continents\nto portray our overall relationship. \n",
