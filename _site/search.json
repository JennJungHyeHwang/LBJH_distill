      "contents": "\nAverage Years of Schooling per Continent\n\n\n\nIn each country there are different years of education and quality of education given, this is another reason why we focused on the 9 countries that would align best with what we wanted to represent and those who had the most comparable data. We have a small bar chart representing the continents we are focused on and the average number of years of education given in the year of 2020.\n\n[1]  4.3  7.0  9.6 12.0 13.4\n\nyears of education min: 4.3 Q1: 7.0 med: 9.6 Q3: 12.0 max: 13.4\nPoverty Rate\n\n\n\nFor the poverty graph we once again went back to the 5 main continents and gathered data for their total population of the continent in 2019, the number of individuals in poverty in 2020, and the poverty rate percentage in 2020. This table was made to once again look at the poverty rate and if there was a trend seen fodatar the number of college graduates for each continent or vaccination percentage in relation to poverty in that continent. The poverty threshold was determined as the minimum amount of income deemed adequate to live off of in that continent.\nMini Geography lesson\nMoving forward through the next couple of graphs we will be looking at 9 countries.\nBrazil, China, Germany, India, Russia, Singapore, Tunisia, The United States, and the United Kingdom.\nREPRESENTATION OF CONTINENTS IS AS FOLLOWS:\nNorth America: US\nSouth America: Brazil\nAsia: India, Singapore, China, and Russia\nEurope: UK, Germany\nAfrica: Tunisia\nStem Majors\n\n\n\nFor the STEM majors, we couldn’t find specific data for the share of graduates from each continent so instead we researched the largest amount of graduates globally in 2020 (the most recent data collected) and looked at what countries had the largest share of graduates. We found 9 countries of interest globally and collected that data, each continent was represented at least once so we are using that data as our sample representation for the continent. We also color coordinated the graphs to each continent so you can see the share from each. We then took those countries from each continent and found the percent share of the graduates that majored in science, technology, engineering, or math. For example we used Tunisia for a representation of the most educated (in STEM) for Africa, Germany, Russia, and The United Kingdom were represented for Europe, The United states was represented for North America, Brazil was represented for South America, and Singapore, India, and China were represented for Asia.\n\n\n\nOnce we collected the data on the percentage of graduates in stem for each country AND the number of graduates in stem for each country we were able to have a rough estimate of the total number of graduates from any institution in any field in 2020. We believe that this information is important because we wanted to look at the relationship between the number of higher educated individuals coming out of each country and their amount of income support, mask mandates, poverty rate and how they were going about the absence of spreading the virus (stay at home requirements). The way we chose to do our graph with the label_number_si caused most of the countries to look insignificant so lets make a plot that excludes china and india (they are very populated countries).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout china it still seems India is an outlier so lets filter again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a much better way to see more a specific number of graduates from each Country\nIncome Support\n\n\n\nIncome support for our project is defined as the relative or amount of income or percentage of income that would be reimbursed for those who lost their job, lost pay, were on unemployment, or those who had to miss work due to the virus (quarantine or exposure) in February of 2021. We used data from February because this is when all continents had the same amount of access to the vaccine and when the virus was at its most deadly without the vaccine. We once again specifically focused on the 9 countries that had the highest number of STEM graduates. There were three categories for income support: less than 50% (less that 50% of the lost wages were returned to the individual), greater than 50% (greater than than 50% of the lost wages were returned to the individual) or none (no loss of wages were reimbursed to the individual. We wanted to look at these countries specifically to see if there was a relationship between the amount of income recovered and the STEM graduates, the stay at home requirements, and the mask mandates.\nStay at Home Requirements\n\n\n\nThe stay at home requirements had three categories beginning with Required (except essentials) meaning it was required to stay at home unless you were commuting to school, work, or store, recommended (meaning you should be in your home but you are free to go out and about as needed) and none, meaning there was no requirement to stay at home during this time. For the 9 countries there were stay at home restrictions for each of them even if the continent as a whole had more lenient rules.\nFace Covering Policies\n\n\n\nAs for the mask mandates there were also three categories which are pretty self explanatory, required outside the home at all times, required in all public spaces, and not required. We once again see that in these 9 countries we have found to have the highest level of stem graduates that there we at least some sort of mask mandate throughout the country. This was a relief to see that the higher educated STEM graduates were also leading in the safety of their country.\nVaccination Data\n\n\n\nAbove We have data for the percent fully vaccinated, percent partially vaccinated, number of fully vaccinated individuals and number of partially vaccinated individuals in November to show how far we have come in our vaccinations.\n\n\n\nThis graph displays the Number of cumulative fully vaccinated individuals in each continent that continues to be on a positive trend as we would expect.\n\n\n\nThis graph displays the Number of cumulative partially vaccinated individuals in each continent that continues to be on a positive trend as we would expect.\n\n\n\nThis graph shows a boxplot for the fully vaccinated individuals across the 9 months, we wanted to show that the medians for all of the months and the countries were relatively the same.\n\n\n\nThis graph shows a boxplot for the partially vaccinated individuals across the 9 months, we wanted to show that the medians for all of the months and the countries were relatively the same, except for Asia which has a much higher median throughout the months.\nMortality Rate\n\n\n\nAs for Confirmed deaths and mortality we once again start our data in February of 2021 and end our data in November of 2021. For this graph we wanted to show the trend of the deaths for each continent and we used a specific code to show this representation. We began February with the total deaths confirmed up to that point and continued with the total death trend until reaching November 1st. We found it interesting to see that some of the trends overlapped and surpassed other countries. This could be due to the lack of vaccinations or requirements during that period of time.\n\n\n\n##Shiny Vaccination Graph with Longitudes and Latitudes\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccinationAcross_LL <- read_excel(\"VaccinationAcross_LL.xlsx\")\ndata2 <- VaccinationAcross_LL\ndata2$long <- as.data.frame(data2$Long)\ndata2$lat <- as.data.frame(data2$Lat)\ndata.SP <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(data2[,c(5,6)], data2[,-c(5,6)])\n\nm <- leaflet() %>%\n  addTiles() %>%\n  addMarkers(data=data2, lng = ~Long, lat = ~Lat, popup = ~Fully_Vaccinated)\nm\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}}},\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addTiles\",\"args\":[\"//{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\",null,null,{\"minZoom\":0,\"maxZoom\":18,\"tileSize\":256,\"subdomains\":\"abc\",\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"tms\":false,\"noWrap\":false,\"zoomOffset\":0,\"zoomReverse\":false,\"opacity\":1,\"zIndex\":1,\"detectRetina\":false,\"attribution\":\"&copy; <a href=\\\"http://openstreetmap.org\\\">OpenStreetMap<\\/a> contributors, <a href=\\\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\\\">CC-BY-SA<\\/a>\"}]},{\"method\":\"addMarkers\",\"args\":[[-11.858997,-11.858997,-11.858997,-11.858997,-11.858997,-11.858997,-11.858997,-11.858997,-11.858997,-11.858997,48.982319,48.982319,48.982319,48.982319,48.982319,48.982319,48.982319,48.982319,48.982319,48.982319,6.453405,6.453405,6.453405,6.453405,6.453405,6.453405,6.453405,6.453405,6.453405,6.453405,30.654249,30.654249,30.654249,30.654249,30.654249,30.654249,30.654249,30.654249,30.654249,30.654249,46.586916,46.586916,46.586916,46.586916,46.586916,46.586916,46.586916,46.586916,46.586916,46.586916],[-55.5184,-55.5184,-55.5184,-55.5184,-55.5184,-55.5184,-55.5184,-55.5184,-55.5184,-55.5184,-104.096421,-104.096421,-104.096421,-104.096421,-104.096421,-104.096421,-104.096421,-104.096421,-104.096421,-104.096421,21.969834,21.969834,21.969834,21.969834,21.969834,21.969834,21.969834,21.969834,21.969834,21.969834,104.067363,104.067363,104.067363,104.067363,104.067363,104.067363,104.067363,104.067363,104.067363,104.067363,2.568303,2.568303,2.568303,2.568303,2.568303,2.568303,2.568303,2.568303,2.568303,2.568303],null,null,null,{\"interactive\":true,\"draggable\":false,\"keyboard\":true,\"title\":\"\",\"alt\":\"\",\"zIndexOffset\":0,\"opacity\":1,\"riseOnHover\":false,\"riseOffset\":250},[104688,2400000,10760000,27170000,40600000,56850000,88190000,135070000,182070000,220360000,7960000,31300000,67330000,123690000,162650000,199420000,227000000,254870000,283670000,311240000,5,330257,4100000,4900000,8670000,15670000,23160000,39240000,61320000,82690000,2190000,11370000,29530000,64390000,106990000,162260000,290420000,1360000000,1740000000,2010000000,3430000,13510000,34710000,66890000,130560000,214610000,301910000,361330000,392670000,412460000],null,null,null,null,{\"interactive\":false,\"permanent\":false,\"direction\":\"auto\",\"opacity\":1,\"offset\":[0,0],\"textsize\":\"10px\",\"textOnly\":false,\"className\":\"\",\"sticky\":true},null]}],\"limits\":{\"lat\":[-11.858997,48.982319],\"lng\":[-104.096421,104.067363]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\nIn order to do our shiny “app” we used the shiny and leaflet package. We wanted to show the points of the graph for the vaccinations in each continent. This however did not exactly happen, we hoped for a more simplistic code in order to do this but we were not super well adapted to shiny applications.\nOne error we got repeatedly was “error: $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors Execution halted” this happened because our data was initially atomic vector and then we made them recursive and more like a list.\nBeing recursive for a type of object in R means that you can have this object holding its own type as an entry. Atomic is the opposite. Vectors are atomic and lists are recursive as we checked, out data (data2) is proved to be recursive.\n\n\nis.atomic(data2$lat)\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\nis.atomic(data2$long)\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\nis.atomic(VaccinationAcross_LL)\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\nis.atomic(data2)\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nOverall Findings\nEurope seems to hsave the\n\n\n\n",
